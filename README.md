## Description:

Crypto Price Quoter is a Python-based program that allows users to quickly and easily obtain the current price of any cryptocurrency in USD using the [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) API. With cryptocurrencies being a new and volatile form of investment, this program aims to simplify the process of getting up-to-date cryptocurrency prices for traders and investors.

3. Run the program by executing `python project.py` in your terminal.
4. Enter the name of the cryptocurrency you wish to quote when prompted, making sure to use correct spelling, otherwise it will prompt again.
